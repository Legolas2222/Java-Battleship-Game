Errors:

- Error Class for custom errors
- 



Board Class:
- Custom Enum for field states, e.g. DeadShip, ActiveShip, EmptyField

OR 

- Custom Field class that hold the enum 

- Organise validators for the board class IN the board class 


For everything: 
- Input classes should NOT Validate
- Dont have everything so chaotic
- settle down on a coordinate format, index of coordinates ?
